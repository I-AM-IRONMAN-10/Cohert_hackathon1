# Bug Investigation Areas

Key Security

* Exposure of sensitive keys
* Improper encryption

Logic

* Duplicate key IDs
* Incorrect key deletion

Security

* Missing authentication
* Missing key masking

Reliability

* File storage race conditions

---

# Objective

Participants must redesign the system to securely manage API keys.

---

# Bonus Improvements

* Implement key rotation
* Add key expiration
* Implement authentication
* Mask API keys in responses
